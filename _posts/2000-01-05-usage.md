# You've got questions. I've got answers.

<br>

## Whats with the name?

The name, *musicsaur*, stands for *Music Synchronization And Uniform Replay*, which is the jargony way I like to describe musicsaur.


## Is it free?

Yes! It's free. Not only that, but its also [open-source](https://github.com/schollz/musicsaur), licensed by the MIT license.

## Can you add songs once the server starts?

Not yet. Songs are only loaded when the server starts. That's a good thing to add though. I'd also like to have better organization of the playlist on the webpage (at least sorted by artist...)


## How come I don't hear anything?

If you don't hear anything, the client is trying to synchronize. Please The browser automatically mutes when it goes out of sync to avoid the headache caused by mis-aligned audio. You can see synchronization progress in [your browser console](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers)

## Does this work on a phone?

Yes, at least for Firefox on Android. To have it work on Chrome, [you need change one of the flags in chrome to allow audio without gestures](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/59134/enable-autoplay-html5-video-in-chrome). To do this, copy and paste this into your Chrome browser:

{% highlight bash %}
chrome://flags/#disable-gesture-requirement-for-media-playback
{% endhighlight %}


# More questions?
