#### You want to sync your music?

# No problem.

musicsaur is *simply* the easiest music synchronization program I know. All you do is run a program and open a browser on the computers that you want to synchronize together. Its fast, easy, and surprisingly good at what it does.

The name, musicsaur, stands for Music Synchronization And Uniform Replay, which is the jargony way I like to describe musicsaur.

## Doesn't this already exist?
