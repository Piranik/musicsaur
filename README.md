Want to sync up your music on multiple computers? This accomplishes exactly that - using only a simple Python server and a browser. Simply run the Python server, and open up a browser on each computer you want to sync up - that's it!

This program is powered by [the excellent howler.js library from goldfire](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js/). Essentially all the client computers [sync their clocks](http://www.mine-control.com/zack/timesync/timesync.html) and then try to start a song at the same time. Any dissimilarities between playback are also fixed, because the clients will automatically seek to the position of the server.

# Installation

If you don't want to install *anything*, just download the [compiled version](link/to/version).

If you're interested in installing the Python version, follow [these instructions](http://www.musicsaur.com/python-full-instructions/).

If you're interested in installing the Golang version, follow [these instructions](http://www.musicsaur.com/golang-full-instructions/).

### Some notes

- If you don't hear anything, the client is probably trying to synchronize. The browser automatically mutes when it goes out of sync to avoid the headache caused by mis-aligned audio. You can see synchronization progress in [your browser console](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers). 
- If you still dont' hear anything, and you're using Chrome browser on Android [you need change one of the flags in chrome to allow audio without gestures](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/59134/enable-autoplay-html5-video-in-chrome). To do this, copy and paste this into your Chrome browser:

```bash
chrome://flags/#disable-gesture-requirement-for-media-playback
```

- If you want to play music from a Raspberry Pi, just type this command (works on headless):

```bash
xinit /usr/bin/midori -a http://W.X.Y.Z:5000
```

OR

```bash
xinit /usr/bin/luakit -u http://W.X.Y.Z:5000
```
